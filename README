Bo2 is a Java development framework that targets to facilitate the development of maintainable software. Its first version was deployed in summer 2009. Since then it is still being actively developed.

Bo2 was created within Interamerican, Greece’s foremost insurance company, initially as an infrastructure layer for the applications developed internally. The framework development was driven by commonly accepted principles which become particularly important in the context of a large application that aims to support a complex and dynamically evolving business.
